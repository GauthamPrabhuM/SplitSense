## Recommendation

**Use Railway** - It's the simplest and most reliable free option. The $5/month credit is more than enough for small apps, and it's truly free unless you exceed that.

All three options:
- ✅ Deploy from GitHub automatically
- ✅ Auto-detect Dockerfile
- ✅ Free SSL/HTTPS
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ No credit card required for free tier

Choose based on your preference!
